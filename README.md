# MULTI AI AGENT SYSTEMS WITH CREWAI

Automate business workflows with multi-AI agent systems.

- Exceed the performance of prompting a single LLM by designing and prompting a team of AI agents through natural language.
- Use an open source library, crewAI, to automate repeatable, multi-step tasks like tailoring a resume to a job description; and automate business processes that are typically done by a group of people, like event planning.
- By creating a team of AI agents, you can define a specific role, goal, and backstory for each agent, which breaks down complex multi-step tasks and assigns them to agents that are customized to perform those tasks.
